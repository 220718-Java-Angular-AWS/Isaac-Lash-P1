<body>
    <!-- Here are mostly simple tags, <h1> is a heading tag making the text larger. <br> is page break, it adds a new line. 
    <input> is the tag for various input elements. The "type" attribute on the input elements tell the browser what type of thing
    goes there. The "id" attribute is how we will find that element when we search the DOM later. Lastly, the button
    element is the button to click and submit the data. <button> has an "onclick" attribute which indicates what behavior
    is invoked when clicked. In this case it invokes the getTasksForUser() method.   -->
    <h1>New User Form</h1>
    First Name: <input type="text" id="fName"><br>
    Last Name: <input type="text" id="lName"><br>
    Email: <input type="text" id="email"><br>
    Password: <input type="password" id="password"><br>
    <button type="button" onclick="getTasksForUser()">Add New User</button>
</body>


<!-- The body is closed, and next we move onto the <script> section of the HTML document. Here we can write Javascript code.
    It doesn't have to be a single function or anything, we can write as much js here as we want. -->

        learn more about how this works later. 

        Our URL is the first parameter in the fetch() call. The second is a java object representing the rest of 
        the necessary HTTP request info, like the method, headers, and body.
