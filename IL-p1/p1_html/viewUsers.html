<!-- We will have a very small html body for this page, it's basically empty with a palceholder we will use to 
add our data to. We give the <div> element an id attribute so that we can find the element in the DOM later.
We want to use this element to add new HTML into the document, the content that comes back from our fetch() request-->
<body>
   
    Get user by Id: <input type="number" onkeypress="return event.charCode >= 48 && event.charCode <= 57" id="userId" value="0"><br>
     <!-- onkeypress="return event.charCode >= 48 && event.charCode <= 57" checks the input as the keyboard keys are pressed to prevent the input of anthing other than 0-9 so no decimals or - allowed -->
    <p>(Leave zero if you want to see them all)</p> <br>

    /* We prepare our API call. This is just like the one in newUserForm.html except it is a GET request and it has no body.
    We still need to add two parameters to fetch(), the url and the object that has the rest of the message stuff.

    This is also a special kind of function, an IIFE. We will learn more about Imediately Invoked Function Expressions later.
    Basically it's just a function that gets called as soon as it is declared.

    This one is also marked "async" which means we can "await" when we need to. Again, we'll discuss that in greater detail later.

    We are also handing off the userId in the parameter list. For now I am hard coding the value of "1" to be sent to this
    function. That id gets concatinated into the url string, which has a parameter list at the end.

            innerHTML is literally the text which would be nested inside the element. In this case the element is the
